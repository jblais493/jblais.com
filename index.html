            <p class="intropara">Welcome to my blog! I have continually wrote as part of a daily meditation to keep myself creative and most importantly, sane.  This blog is a reflection of my inner workings, and frankly, whatever may be on my mind at any given moment.  I want to share my writings with the world in the way that I know how, and provoke deep conversations with like (and unlike) minded people.  I love meeting new people in my travels, and I generally post where I will be in the world in effort to meet even more.</p>

            <p>I am a real estate broker and president of Revre Technologies, a platfrom looking to completely revolutionize how we see real estate, incorporationg modern technologies to benefit the consumer in all ways.  I also run a software and design outfit, Streamlyned.com which focuses on creating awesome solutions for clients that want more for their business.  My passion for finacial markets has led me to trade in derivatives and commodities, and to learn about programming systems that aid in these transactions.  I love working hard and creating something from nothing, and in out world today, I find it truly inspiring that you can run a business from a laptop in a coffeeshop anywhere in the world.</p>

            <p>In my free time, you'l find me reading a book or learning about some abstract thing because I'm like that.  I am an avid guitar player, and try to play once a day just to clear my mind.  I love travelling and experiencing new things and places, and have been to 20 countries so far; but that will change continuously.  I am working towards fluency in French, Spanish, Italian, and wanting to speak another 6 or 7 languages before my time is up.  You can follow me on Instagram, Facebook, and Goodreads to see more of what I'm up to.
